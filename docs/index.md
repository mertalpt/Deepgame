# DEEPGAME

Deepgame will be a product/technology that leverages deepfake algorithms in order to make game characters appear and sound like a real person.
This product is innovative since it will use deepfake algorithms for game character customization, which has not been tried in the industry.
Games integrating our product will have the option to customize characters via feeding images and recordings to tool’s personalization engine. Afterwards the engine will transfer the input features onto the generic model inside where it can be used in the game. A similar approach will be taken with regards to audio, using recordings to make generic lines sound like spoken by the input person.
